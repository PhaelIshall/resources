    - Code: https://github.com/prokolyvakis/hyperkg
    - Contribution:  Geometrical space of the models has a huge implact on their performance for KBC.
    They demonstrate that when models with a lagging performance are extended to the hyperbolic space ,their performance increases significantly. They also show a new promising direction for developing models that better represent certain families of rules opening up for more fine-grained reasoning tasks
